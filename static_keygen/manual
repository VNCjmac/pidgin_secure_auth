### CUSTOM AUTHORIZATION PIDGIN ###
===================================

One person in the conversation will run keygen.py. This will generate a list of 500 keys and
values. You must send this file to everyone in the conversation. If this file is intercepted
then this method of authorization is no longer secure.

The person who asks the Question will run query.py. This will open the specified keyfile
and extract a random key and value separated by two colons (::). The first side is the Key,
the second is the Value. This is crucial for the authentication. When asking the question,
You must enter the Key as the question. The Value (second half) is the answer.

The person who has received the Question will run auth.py. This takes the Question (authkey)
and the keyfile as arguments. This will run through each key and value in the keyfile and if
there is any matching pair it will be printed separated by double colons (::). The first
half is the Question asked by the user and the second half is the answer. This answer will 
be the answer that guarantees your authentication
